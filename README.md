# some-chrome-ext

### Intention

Learn!
### Direction

Following the chrome ext tutorial (found here)[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/].
Left off at the section to write the (background script)[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/], since I believed I had to write it myself and would've put that off. Now that I look again, I'm not sure that's the case.
### Goal

Leverage the skills and information learned in this tutorial to build an original chrome extension.
