# some-chrome-ext

### Intention

Learn!
### Direction

Following the chrome ext tutorial [found here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/).
Left off at the section to write a [background script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/), since I believed I had to write it myself and would've put that off. Reading it again, I see that I misinterpreted.
### Goal

Leverage the skills and information learned in this tutorial to build an original chrome extension.
